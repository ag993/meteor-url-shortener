Intro
==============

A URL shortening service built with Meteor.

List of Features
==============

- User account system: Logged in users can manage their previously-created URLs.

- List of recently-created public URLs.

- URL input validation.

- Visits tracking for each short URL with real-time statistics update. This functionality is still very basic: number of visits by browser, OS, or country, and is not 100% accurate due to the dependence on user-agent.
