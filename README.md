A URL shortening service built with Meteor.

List of features:

_ User account system: Logged in users can manage their previously-created URLs.

_ List of recently-created public URLs.

_ URL input validation.

_ Visits tracking for each short URL with real-time statistics update. This functionality is still very basic: number of visits by browser, OS, or country, and is not 100% accurate due to the dependence on user-agent.
