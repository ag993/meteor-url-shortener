A URL shortening service built with Meteor.

List of features:
_ User account system: Logged in users can manage their previously-created URLs.
_ List of recently-created public URLs.
_ URL input validation.
_ Visits tracking for each short URL created (currently very basic: number of visits by browser, OS, or country)
